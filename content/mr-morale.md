# Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. __So it's time for us to interfere in his life.__ *Shut up and take my money!* And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

## I just told you! You've killed me!

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

1. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
2. Take me to your leader!
3. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

### You're going to do his laundry?

Say what? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I'm a thing. I wish! It's a nickel.

* Really?!
* Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
* Ask her how her day was.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Yeah, lots of people did. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! When will that be?

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Okay, I like a challenge. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Bender, we're trying our best.

You're going to do his laundry? Bender, we're trying our best. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Why not indeed! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. No, just a regular mistake.

I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. I'm Santa Claus! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Then we'll go with that data file! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. And I'm his friend Jesus. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once. Leela's gonna kill me. You are the last hope of the universe. I can explain. It's very valuable. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
