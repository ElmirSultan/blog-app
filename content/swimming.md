## Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. **But with the blast shield down, I can't even see!** _How am I supposed to fight?_ The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

## Ye-ha!

As you wish. Red Five standing by. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

1. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
2. Don't underestimate the Force.
3. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

### What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

- But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?
- Don't underestimate the Force.
- She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You mean it controls your actions? You mean it controls your actions?

Don't underestimate the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. You mean it controls your actions? I find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. As you wish. I'm trying not to, kid. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You don't believe in the Force, do you?

Red Five standing by. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
